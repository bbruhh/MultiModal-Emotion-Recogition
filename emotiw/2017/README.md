# EmotiW 2017

## Description

Run the code as: ```python3 submission5.py```

The code will download all necessary features precomputed using our models, train emotion classification models and predict emotions on the test set.

Test accuracy is 60.03% (second place).

### Requirements
- Python3 (necessary to load features saved in python3)

### Test environment
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
